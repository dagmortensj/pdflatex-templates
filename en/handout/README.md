# handout-template

LaTeX template for physics and mathematics handouts and problem sheets.
Calm, classic typography with theorem and exercise environments, lettered
subproblems, and dark red separator rules.

## Files

| File              | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `main.tex`        | Starting point — content lives here        |
| `handoutstyle.sty`| All formatting; rarely changed             |
| `figures/`        | Folder for figures; loaded automatically   |

## Getting started

1. Copy the entire folder to a new project
2. Open `main.tex` and fill in title, date, content
3. Compile:

```
pdflatex main
pdflatex main
```

(No bibliography by default — handouts and problem sheets
typically don't need one. Add `natbib` and a `.bib` file
if you ever do.)

## Useful commands

### Exercises

```latex
\begin{exercise}
Prompt for the exercise.

\begin{subproblems}
  \item First subproblem.
  \item Second subproblem.
\end{subproblems}
\end{exercise}
```

Exercises are numbered per section (e.g. Exercise 2.1, 2.2)
and use plain letter labels for subproblems (a, b, c), with
the same indent as ordinary lists. The `subproblems`
environment leaves ordinary `enumerate` lists untouched for
normal use.

Exercises are set at full width, without indentation,
separated from the prose by space: 4.5ex before and 6.75ex
after. Less room before ties the exercise to its lead-in;
more room after marks it as finished. Two consecutive
exercises share the larger distance — space never stacks.

Use `\begin{subproblems}[resume]` to continue the same letter
sequence after explanatory prose between subproblems.

### Unnumbered mode

```latex
\usepackage[unnumbered]{handoutstyle}
```

For a handout about a single topic: the section headings lose
their numbers, and exercises and theorems count flat through
the whole document — Exercise 1, 2, 3 and Theorem 1, 2, 3
instead of 1.1, 1.2. Everything else (fonts, spacing, heading
style) is unchanged. Without the option the template behaves
as before.

### Block paragraphs

```latex
\usepackage[blockparagraphs]{handoutstyle}
```

Paragraphs separated by space instead of indentation: half a
baseline between them, and no indent. Suits a handout that is
mostly exercises and short instructions. The title block and
the exercise head keep the same distances as otherwise. The
options combine: `[unnumbered,blockparagraphs]`. Do not load
the `parskip` package as well — the option does the job.

### Theorem-like environments

```latex
\begin{theorem}
  Statement of the theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition}
  Definition text.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  A remark.
\end{remark}
```

All three share a single counter scoped to the section,
e.g. Theorem 1.1, Definition 1.2, Remark 1.3.

### Boxes: important and mainresult

```latex
\begin{important}
\begin{definition}
  ...
\end{definition}
\end{important}

\begin{mainresult}[Law of gravitation]   % title can be omitted
\begin{theorem}
  ...
\end{theorem}
\end{mainresult}
```

`important` sets thin dark red rules above and below the content —
for important definitions. `mainresult` sets a hairline frame
around the document's central result; with the optional argument
the title sits in letterspaced small caps breaking the top frame
rule, without it the frame stands clean. Both are wrappers around
the ordinary environments: numbering continues in the same
sequence as elsewhere, and the boxes break across pages. Use them
sparingly — box everything and the box is no longer a signal.

### Python code

```latex
\begin{python}
import numpy as np

def f(x):
    return np.sin(x)   # example function

print(f(np.pi / 2))
\end{python}
```

Typesets Python with Gruvbox Light syntax highlighting: coloured
keywords, strings, comments, and line numbers on a warm cream background,
framed top and bottom. UTF-8 input is enabled, so Norwegian characters
(æ, ø, å) work in surrounding text and in code comments.

### Separator

```latex
\separator
```

A thin dark red rule with vertical space on either side.
Use between content blocks — after an exercise, between
examples, or at a topic shift within a section.

### Equations

```latex
\begin{equation}
  E = mc^2.
  \label{eq:einstein}
\end{equation}
% Reference with \eqref{eq:einstein}
```

### Figures

```latex
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{filename}
  \caption{Figure caption.}
  \label{fig:label}
\end{figure}
```

### TikZ figures

`handoutstyle.sty` does not load TikZ — add `\usepackage{tikz}` to the
custom packages block in `main.tex` when you need native figures.

The style file defines five named colors. Their roles are fixed:

| Color        | RGB          | Role                                                         |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `darkorange` | 184, 92, 0   | Primary figure accent: strokes, nodes, bars                  |
| `darkolive`  | 74, 107, 18  | Secondary figure accent: curves, fills                       |
| `darkblue`   | 30, 96, 140  | Third figure accent                                          |
| `darkplum`   | 110, 50, 120 | Fourth figure accent                                         |
| `darkred`    | 120, 20, 20  | Reserved — footnote rule and structural accents; not for figures |

Black and gray are the structural colors in figures: axes, grids, guide
lines, walls, and coordinate labels. The palette colors carry content —
curves, series, and marked regions.

Typical usage:

```latex
\draw[very thick, darkorange] (0,0) -- (2,0);
\node[circle, fill=darkorange, inner sep=1.4pt] at (1,0) {};
\fill[darkorange!12] (0,0) rectangle (2,1);
\draw[darkolive, thick, domain=0:3, samples=60]
    plot (\x, {sin(deg(\x))});
\draw[->, darkolive!75] (0,0) -- (1,1);
\draw[darkblue, thick, dashed] (0,1) -- (3,1);
\draw[darkplum, thick, dotted] (0,0.5) -- (3,0.5);
```

## Typography

- **Font:** MLModern (T1)
- **Page size:** A4, symmetric margins (3.0 cm L/R)
- **Line spacing:** 1.04
- **Align rows:** `\jot` = 8 pt (default 3 pt) — more air between the
  rows of `align`, shared by all the templates
- **Paragraphs:** indented, no line break — or space (half a
  baseline) instead of indentation with `[blockparagraphs]`
- **Microtypography:** protrusion, expansion, tracking enabled
- **Headings:** two quiet levels — section (`\large`) and subsection (body size), bold; no oversized fonts or rules. The subsection lets the handout double as lecture notes.
- **Title block:** small caps, letterspaced, centered
- **Hyperlinks and rules:** dark red, print-safe
