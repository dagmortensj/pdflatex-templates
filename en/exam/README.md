# exam template

LaTeX template for tests in physics and mathematics at upper
secondary level. Derived from the handout template and stripped
of what a test does not need (theorems, boxes), with what it does
need added: a title block with fields for name, date, time and
aids, Part 1 / Part 2 the way the Norwegian exams are split, and
"Page 2 of 5" at the foot of every page.

## Files

| File            | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `main.tex`      | The starting point — the exercises go here   |
| `examstyle.sty` | All formatting; rarely changed               |
| `figures/`      | Put figures here; `\graphicspath` points to it |

## Getting started

1. Copy the whole folder into a new project
2. Open `main.tex` and fill in the metadata and exercises
3. Compile with pdflatex:

```
latexmk -pdf main
```

`latexmk` is not just convenience here: "Page 2 of 5" takes the
total from the previous run (a label in `.aux`), so the document
needs two passes.

## Title block

```latex
\title{Physics 1 Test}
\subtitle{Chapters 3 and 4: Forces and motion}
\date{Thursday 15 October 2026}
\duration{90 minutes}
\aids{Part 1: none. Part 2: all, except communication}
% \namelabel{Candidate number}   % default is "Name"
\maketitle
```

Title and subtitle in sans, left-aligned. Below them four fields:
Name (an open line to write on), Date, Time and Aids. An empty
field is shown as empty — it is easier to see that something is
missing than that something was left out. `\shownamefieldfalse`
in the preamble removes the name line, for a test submitted
digitally.

## Cover page, booklet, or neither

```latex
\usepackage[coverpage]{examstyle}   % full-day test, two parts
\usepackage[booklet]{examstyle}     % the same, for duplex printing and folding
\usepackage{examstyle}              % smaller test
```

With `[coverpage]` the title block gets a page of its own without
a page number, and everything between `\maketitle` and the first
`\exampart` — instructions, mark allocation — stays there. The
first `\exampart` — or the first exercise, if the test has no
parts — closes the cover and begins on "Page 1 of N", so N counts
only the exercise pages. Should the cover run over several pages,
all of them are unnumbered. Without the option the title block
sits at the top of page 1 with the exercises straight below, as
a smaller test wants.

`[booklet]` turns on `[coverpage]` and adds what duplex printing
needs: a blank back on the cover, so Part 1 begins on a right-hand
page; every later `\exampart` on a right-hand page (a blank page
is inserted when needed, so Part 2 starts on a fresh sheet and
can be separated from Part 1); and blank pages at the end until
the page count is divisible by 4, as a folded booklet requires. A
page inserted between the parts carries a page number like the
others, so "Page 2 of 4" shows nothing is missing; the blank
pages at the end sit outside the count, like the cover. Do not
use it for a test printed single-sided.

## Status check

```latex
\usepackage[statuscheck]{examstyle}
...
\title{Status check, Mathematics R2}
\subtitle{Differentiation}
\date{Monday 5 October 2026}
\maketitle

\level{1}
\begin{exercise} ... \end{exercise}
\level{2}
...
```

For a status check rather than a test: the title block becomes
title, subtitle and date — no name line, time or aids
(`\duration` and `\aids` are ignored), and no rule below; the one
under the first `\level` takes over. `\level` is `\exampart` with
the word "Level": the same heading, the same spacing, an optional
subline in brackets — plus a thin dark-red rule underneath, so
the levels read as blocks. The exercises count flat across the
levels as elsewhere.

## Part 1 and Part 2

```latex
\exampart[Without aids]{1}
...
\clearpage
\exampart[With aids]{2}
```

`\exampart{1}` without the optional argument gives just "Part 1".
The command does not break the page itself (apart from the cover
break above) — `\clearpage` before Part 2 if Part 1 is to be
handed in separately.

The exercises count flat through the whole test, Exercise 1, 2,
3, continuing across the part boundary. A smaller test without
parts simply omits `\exampart`; the numbering is the same. To
restart Part 2 at Exercise 1: `\setcounter{exerciseinner}{0}`
right after `\exampart`.

## Exercises

```latex
\begin{exercise}[Incline \points{4}]
Exercise text.

\begin{subproblems}
  \item First subproblem.
  \item Second subproblem.
\end{subproblems}
\end{exercise}
```

The same environment as in the handout and notes templates, so
an exercise can be moved here unchanged. The head is set in bold
sans one step up — "Exercise 3 – Title" — and the body in roman.
`\points{4}` sets "(4 points)" in grey and belongs at the end of
the title; leave it out if the test does not state points.
`\begin{subproblems}[resume]` continues the letter sequence after
intervening text.

## Multiple choice

```latex
The horizontal component of the velocity is
\begin{multiplechoice}
  \item zero
  \item constant, but non-zero
  \item increasing
  \item decreasing
\end{multiplechoice}
```

The alternatives get A, B, C, D in sans without a parenthesis, so
they stand apart from the subproblems' a), b) — but with the same
indent, so A sits under a). The list works directly in the exercise
or inside a subproblem; there it steps in once more, like a nested
list. The space between
alternatives is larger than between subproblems — alternatives
are often fractions and other formulas that otherwise bunch up.
No page break is allowed between the question and A, nor between
the alternatives, but one is allowed after the last, so A–D always
stay with their question.

## Python code

```latex
\begin{python}
for i in range(3):
    print(i)   # comment with æ, ø, å
\end{python}
```

For programming exercises. Line numbers make it possible to ask
about "line 7". Keep comments short enough that no line wraps —
if one does, the numbering shifts.

## Other

- `\separator` — a short dark-red rule with air around it, for a
  change of topic or before a closing instruction
- `[indent]` as a package option brings back paragraph
  indentation instead of space between paragraphs; combines with
  the others
- `esvect` (`\vv{F}`), `siunitx` and `tikz` are loaded from
  `main.tex`; remove what is not needed. Indices belong outside
  the arrow: `\vv{F}_1`, not `\vv{F_1}` — otherwise the arrow
  spans the index too

## Typography

- **Typeface:** MLModern (T1), text and mathematics; MLModern Sans
  for the title, parts and exercise heads — the same family, the
  same x-height, no extra font
- **Size:** 12 pt — one step above the handout, because a test is
  read quickly, under pressure, and often as a copy
- **Engine:** pdflatex
- **Page layout:** A4, 3.0 cm margins; 150 mm measure
  (2.8 lowercase alphabets at 12 pt)
- **Leading:** 1.04
- **Paragraphs:** space (half a baseline), not indentation
- **Page numbers:** "Page 2 of 5" centred at the foot, page 1
  included; the cover (with `[coverpage]`) sits outside the count
- **Headings:** "Part 1" in `\Large` bold sans, subline in regular
  sans below; exercise heads in `\large` bold sans
- **Colours:** dark-red rule under the title block and in
  `\separator`; `darkorange` and `darkolive` for figures, as in
  the rest of the family
- **No hyperref:** a test is printed; references are set in
  black. If links are needed, load `hyperref` last in `main.tex`
